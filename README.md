# Hi, I'm Lou 👋

Software developer passionate about **systems programming**, **backend development**, and building performant, scalable solutions.

## 💻 What I Do

I specialize in **low-level programming** and **backend infrastructure**, with a focus on:

- **Network Programming** – Building HTTP servers, managing TCP/IP connections, implementing event-driven architectures with epoll
- **Systems Engineering** – Memory management, process handling, file I/O optimization
- **DevOps & Containerization** – Docker, multi-container orchestration, automated deployment pipelines
- **Performance Optimization** – Writing efficient, clean code with minimal overhead

## 🛠️ Technical Skills

**Languages:** C, C++, Shell scripting  
**Backend & Systems:** Socket programming, non-blocking I/O, HTTP protocol implementation  
**DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, Makefiles, CI/CD  
**Tools & Methodologies:** Git, Linux/Unix, debugging with GDB/Valgrind, test-driven development  

## 🚀 Current Work

I'm currently developing:
- A **production-ready HTTP server** in C++ handling concurrent connections with epoll-based event notification
- **Containerized web infrastructure** with multi-service orchestration and automated configuration
- Various **system utilities** and libraries exploring memory management and algorithm optimization

## 🎯 Interests

- Backend architecture and API design
- Network protocols and distributed systems
- Performance engineering and profiling
- Open source contributions
